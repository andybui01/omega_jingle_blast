# OJB - Omega Jingle Blast

An education exercise in making a RISC-V hypervisor.

## Project structure

Cat's out of the bag: code was initially retrieved from https://wiki.osdev.org/RISC-V_Meaty_Skeleton_with_QEMU_virt_board because I'm not arsed to make my own skeleton lmfao.

A `Makefile` is provided for building the project using `make`.

- `src/`: C source code files and other assets for building the kernel image
  - `src/kmain.c`: Kernel entry point
  - `src/asm/`: Assembly files, for hardware initialization and other low-level stuff not doable in C
  - `src/lds/`: Linker scripts for linking object files generated by our cross-compiler, specialized for our OS kernel
- `misc/`: Miscellaneous files and utilities
  - `misc/riscv64-virt.dts`: Device tree file for 64-bit RISC-V `virt` board provided by QEMU
  - `misc/gallery/`: Image gallery containing screenshots and other artefacts documenting my progress through the project
